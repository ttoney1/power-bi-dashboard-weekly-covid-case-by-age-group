# power-bi-dashboard-weekly-covid-case-by-age-group
The Power BI dashboard visualizes national-level trends in COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths by age group, with a separate, interactive State Dashboard (not shown in the file) allowing users to drill down to individual state-level data.

Tab Descriptions
First Tab:
Interactive line and area charts displaying COVID case rates by age group.
Hovering over a week (e.g., April 2023) reveals specific data in a pop-up tooltip.

Second Tab:
Includes a pivot table (aggregated by age group), line chart, and area chart for COVID case trends.

Third to Eight Tabs:
Contain additional variations or breakdowns of the main indicators (e.g., week-to-week trends in 7-day moving average and proportion for hospitalizations, deaths, and emergency department visits by age group).
Also, interactive; shows a pop-up when hovering over a week in July, revealing that weekâ€™s specific statistics.

Functionality Notes
Interactive features: Users can hover to get detailed info.

Separate dashboard - State-level dashboard: Not included in the screenshots but contain over 50 pages (one per state) with the same type of chart as the national dashboard.
The user can stay on one tab/page (e.g. for case rates) and click the state filter to display information for that state.
